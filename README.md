Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a complete website application which is composed of:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

A database or files that store data (data = objects)

An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

Description of the command interpreter:
This is exactly the same as the Bash shell but limited to a specific use-case solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website. In this case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

This command line interpreter serve as alternative to frontend where user can interact with the backend which was developed using the Python Objects-Oriented Programming

Thus, the following action can be performed;

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

Update attributes of an object

Destroy an object

How to start interact
